## About

One Bot framework to rule them all.
Build one app that supports multiple engines (Wit.ai, Api.ai, RegExp, etc) and multiple chat platforms (SMS texting or calling with Twilio, Facebook Messenger, Slack, Telegram, Kik, etc). 
All with a single, powerful, and unified API. 
One code base, any platform you want. 
Is to Bots as React Native is to native mobile apps.
